# Overall Objectives

- [ ] implement **refactor methods** for duplicated code
- [ ] integrate **loading bars** for long operations (optional, is probably gonna slow everything down)
- [ ] **threading** or **multiprocessing** to improve GUI responsiveness
- [ ] **document** all core files and modules.

---

# Current Bugs

- GUI is **very slow and unresponsive** (probs due to synchronous blocking operations).

---

# Today

- [x] finish docs
- [x] fix `save_refactored_file` function:
  - make sure it works with **multiple duplicated functions**.
  - also make sure it doesn't corrupt the original file.

# Metrics, Coverge, and Code Smells Goals and Reports

- **Coverage: `coverage`**

  - [ ] have coverage > 85%, the higher the better
  - currently at 73%
  - **Critical:**
    - `refactor.py` is at `41%`
    - `file_saver.py` is at `43%`
    - `utility.py` is at `53%`
    - `new_ui` is at `56%`

**Results as of now (Fri May 23rd):**

# Known Issues

- GUI performance needs improvement (hella slow rn)
- Sometimes, residual **function signatures and bodies** are not being fully removed after refactor.
- Jaccard similarity is actually **too brittle** for small snippets:
  - rn, it works as designed (trigram-based).
  - probs needs to be replaced or enhanced with a more robust heuristic.

---

# Fix Strategy

- Only validate **context-free logical blocks** for refactoring.
- On replacement:
  - Do **not call helper globally**.
  - **Preserve indentation** exactly.
  - **Replace blocks in-place** instead of appending helper only.

---

# Tech Gaps

- **Function argument matching** isnâ€™t preserved.
- **Return values** are assumed identical -> may not be true.
- Requires **Python 3.8+** for `ast.end_lineno`.
