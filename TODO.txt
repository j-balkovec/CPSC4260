OVERALL:
- Implement REFACTOR methods
- Logging if necessary
- Loading bars
- Threading
- Print in color
- info messages in color @ see analyze.py (generate_readable_report)
- TXT report to HTML somewhere down the road

BUG:
- The Application is very slow and unresponsive

TODAY:
- Split up analyze.py
- Fix find duplicated code problem
- Refactor method
- [maybe] fix gui problem...shift to terminal only or use the terminal GUI only...ideally would have 2 options


- Do the backend part first, figure out the frontend later

ISSUES:
 - Finding duplicated code...
 - GUI
 - NO refactor method yet


NOTE:

 - Note all the try-catch blocks in main to exit gracefully
